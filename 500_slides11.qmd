## Lehr et al. (2019) Central Message

![](c11/figures/lehr02.png)

## Propensity Score (from Lehr 2019)

A logistic regression model was used to estimate the propensity score; having an HRD/IRD was modeled as the outcome with all recipient and donor characteristics (see next slide) as independent variables. 

- A greedy matching algorithm was used to select the best match from the same definition cohort for each recipient; all HRD/IRD recipients were matched. 
- The standardized differences in all covariates before and after matching were evaluated to assess matching success. (See Figure 2 in two slides.)

### Outcomes

The primary outcome was posttransplant patient survival. Secondary outcomes included graft survival and acute rejection (treated) within 1 year of transplant. Outcomes were assessed using the matched cohort. Patient and graft survival were evaluated using Cox regression with a robust sandwich covariance matrix estimate to account for intracluster dependence due to matching.

## Recipient and Donor Characteristics

Recipient characteristics included in the propensity score model were age, sex, body mass index, race, primary source of payment for transplant, median income in past 12 months by ZIP code, education, history of cigarette use, diabetes, Lung Allocation Score (LAS), lung disease group, Karnofsky functional group, life support, previous lung surgery, previous transplants for other organs, most recent serum creatinine, total bilirubin before transplant, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) %, infection requiring intravenous drug therapy within 2 weeks before transplant, transplant year/definition of high risk, time on waiting list, total ischemic time, and procedure type. 

In addition, the following donor characteristics were also included: age, sex, body mass index, race, ABO group, alcohol use, history or recent use of cigarettes, cocaine, other drugs, death by stroke, death by non-beating heart.

# Questions and Answers about the Project

# Dealing with Time-Varying Covariates

## When Do Time-Varying Covariates Arise?

- When a treatment may be given at various times, we need to form matched pairs or sets in which subjects are similar prior to treatment, but avoid matching on events that followed treatment.
- In **risk-set matching**, a newly treated subject at time T is matched to controls who are not treated at time T based on covariate information describing subjects prior to time T.

## Risk-Set Matching in a Study of Surgery for Interstitial Cystitis

- Effects of surgery (cyctoscopy & hydrodistention) on symptoms of IC (chronic urologic disorder)
    - IC Database - patients can enter after at least six months of IC symptoms
    - Patients evaluated at entry, then every 3 months
    - Pain (0-9), Urgency (0-9), Nocturnal Voiding Freq.
- Patients were treated periodically, not selected at random - those who find current symptoms unbearable will presumably opt for surgery

See Li, Propert and Rosenbaum 2001, Rosenbaum 2010, Chapter 12

## Matching in the IC study

Can't compare all "surgery" to all "no surgery" patients since if you never had surgery, your symptoms probably were never intolerable.

- Want to create pairs of patients who were similar up to the moment one had surgery
- Matching makes pairs comparable pre-treatment
- What happens after treatment is an outcome
- Each new surgical patient is paired with a control who had similar symptoms up to the point of surgery for the surgical patient

## What is the Exposure here?

We're estimating the effect of the choice that patients and their surgeons keep facing...

- Surgery Now vs. Delaying Surgery
    - with the delay being into the indefinite future

We're comparing Matched Pairs to estimate the impact of this decision

## Match on Observed History

- Patient A has surgery at time T, with covariate values a

Find a matched control by selecting from those potential controls who:

- Have covariate history = a (or close to it)
- Who did not receive the treatment at time T

At time T, select a match for a patient getting surgery (with history a) from among the set of unmatched controls with similar history.

## Matching Algorithm

- Use a distance metric as we've seen previously, but with a change.
- Distance between patient with surgery at time T and a patient who had not yet received surgery as of time T computed using covariates for those two patients up to time T
- Used no information obtained after time T.

## Another Example: Maturity at Discharge from Neonatal ICU

- Babies are kept in NICU until they have matured sufficiently to go home.
- Once babies look mature enough they stay around for "a few days" just to be sure.
- Does a longer stay in the NICU benefit those babies who receive it?

Silber et al 2009, Rosenbaum 2010 Section 12.3

## NICU Maturity at Discharge Study

- 1402 premature infants (gestational age no more than 34 weeks) born at KP in Northern CA: 1998-2002
- Approach: risk-set matching using time-dependent propensity scores and an optimal nonbipartite matching 
- Result: 1402 babies divided into 701 pairs so that one was an "early baby" and the other was a "late baby" but were similar at the postmenstrual age (to the day) that the "early baby" went home.

## Available Covariate Information (1402 babies)

- 20 fixed (not time-dependent) covariates
    - Gestational age at birth, weight at birth, sex
    - Baby's health history
    - Mom covariates
- 13 time-dependent (maturity) covariates
    - Postmenstrual age, Current weight
    - Propensity to discharge
    - Six maturity measures scored daily (1 if not achieved, 0 if achieved) with exponential smoothing applied to the binary variables.

## Time-Dependent Propensity Score

- Fit a Cox proportional hazards model to describe the hazard of discharge on a particular day, using as predictors both the fixed and time-dependent variables
- The linear portion (log-hazard of discharge) is then taken as the time-dependent PS
- The PS will thus vary from day to day for each baby.

Lu (2005) descibed the general approach.

## Optimal Non-Bipartite Matching

- Non-bipartite matching doesn't presuppose treated patients and controls
- Begin instead with a single group and form pairs so as to minimize the distance between paired subjects or sets of matched subjects
- Very flexible - permits looking at doses, for instance, or matching with several groups

Lu, Zanutto et al. 2002,  Rosenbaum 2010, Chapter 11

## Doing Risk-Set, Optimal Bipartite Matching in this Study

- Proportional hazards model gives time-dependent PS for each baby
- Built a 1402 x 1402 distance matrix comparing babies to one another.
- If the baby in row i and in column j were discharged on same day, used infinite distance.
- Otherwise, value in cell i, j describes distance between babies on the day earlier baby was discharged, with a caliper on the PS.

## Conclusions?

Did the "late babies" benefit from a few more days to grow in the NICU?

- As it turns out, the "early" and "late" babies had similar experiences after discharge.
- No real strong indications of either benefit or harm for those with the extra time in NICU.
    - Not that NICUs aren't expensive places to be...

# Augmenting a Sensivity Analysis (Rosenbaum 2017, Chapter 9)

## Augmenting a Sensitivity Analysis

Lots of things can be described as part of a sensitivity analysis. We are focusing on one issue: quantifying departures from randomized (i.e. ignorable) treatment assignment.

Ignorable treatment assignment means that if two people have the same values of the observed covariates (and thus, for example, the same propensity score) then they have the same probability of treatment.

- As discussed in Chapter 9, Rosenbaum's bounds on $\Gamma$ are just one possibility.

- $\Gamma$ and $\Theta_p$ and $\Lambda$ and $\Delta$ are just different methods of describing departure from ignorable treatment assignment in matched pairs, although only $\Gamma$ applies outside of matched pairs.

## $\Gamma$ and $\Theta_p$

We can express this in terms of $\Gamma$ or $\Theta_p$ pretty easily in the matched pairs setting.

$$
\frac{1}{1 + \Gamma} \leq \Theta_p \leq \frac{\Gamma}{1 + \Gamma}
$$

$\Gamma$ = 2 is the same magnitude of departure from ignorable treatment assignment as the interval from 0.33 to 0.67 for $\Theta_p$.

If $\Gamma$ = 2, then Harry might be twice as likely as Sally to receive the treatment (so Harry's probability $\Theta_H$ is 2/3 and Sally's is 1/3) or Sally might be twice as likely as Harry (so Harry's probability could be as low as 1/3) to receive the treatment.

## Amplifying the $\Gamma$ value with $\Lambda$ and $\Delta$

This approach, like $\Theta_p$ bounds, applies only in the case of matched pairs.

- $\Lambda$ tells you about the relationship of an unobserved covariate with treatment assignment.
- $\Delta$ tells you about the relationship of an unobserved covariate with the outcome.

$$
\Gamma = (\Lambda \Delta + 1) / (\Lambda + \Delta)
$$

## Rosenbaum, 2017, Table 9.1

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("c11/figures/table_91.png")
```

## Using the Amplification

If $\Gamma = 1.5$ then, for example we could use 

- a bound on $\Theta_p$ from 0.40 to 0.60
- or a combination of $\Lambda = 2$ and $\Delta = 4$
- or a combination of $\Lambda = 4$ and $\Delta = 2$
- or a requirement that $\Lambda = 1.5$ and that the unobserved covariate be a perfect predictor of the outcome.
- or a requirement that $\Delta = 1.5$ and that the unobserved covariate be a perfect predictor of treatment assignment.

## Summary: Sensitivity Analysis

Hidden bias is the great problem with observational studies, and with PS models.

- Sensitivity analysis after matching can be applied in many scenarios.
- We hope to find that an unobserved covariate would have to be very powerful to alter our conclusions.
- That doesn't mean that such a covariate (or set of them) doesn't exist.
- You should be running a sensitivity analysis in your Project only if your matched sample results show an effect size which implies an impact for your exposure.
