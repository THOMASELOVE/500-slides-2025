## Agenda for Zoom Meeting

Thursday 2025-01-16 from 10 to 11 AM. Zoom details in your email and on [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/).

- Welcome to 500
- Logistics of the Course, Assignments
- A Motivating Example: Aspirin and Mortality in Heart Patients
    + How can we avoid being misled?
    + Causal Effects as comparing potential outcomes
- Your Questions

## Course Overview

* Randomized Experiments vs. Observational Studies
    + Randomization as the "fundamental basis for inference"
    + Observational Studies and Causal Effects
* Propensity Scores: Crucial Tools for Causal Models
    + Selection Bias: key issue for observational studies
    + Dealing with Bias (both overt and hidden)
    + Subclassification (stratification) and direct regression adjustment
    + Matching and weighting using the Propensity Score
    + Sensitivity Analysis
* Instrumental Variables and Other Techniques
* Using R, RStudio and Quarto to accomplish all of this

Paul Rosenbaum's 2023 book *Causal Inference*

## My Expectations

* You are interested in learning about the effects of an intervention, treatment or policy on subjects when the treatments cannot be assigned at random.
* You have little interest in technical details of methods, but serious interest in designing, conducting and analyzing observational studies skillfully.
* You have access to software (specifically R) which you can use to obtain basic hypothesis testing, regression and logistic regression results.

## This Year is Unusual

- Classes 1-8 (before Spring Break) involve:
    - a recorded 60-90 minute lecture (like this one)
    - a Zoom meeting to discuss the lecture and other issues from 10-11 AM on Thursday
- After Spring Break, starting with Class 9 (2025-03-20) we will meet in person from 8:30 AM to 11:15 AM in Wolstein Research Building room 1217 on the CWRU campus.
- For all sessions, Dr. Love is available after class for informal "office hours".
- Recordings of class sessions will be available through Zoom on Canvas when things work properly.

    - Final presentation of your work in class April 10, 17 or 24.
2. Observational Studies in Action
    - Present methods/results from a published article using propensity scores.
    - You'll present once as primary reviewer, once as second reviewer.
    - First step is to identify a study and claim it by 2025-02-19.
3. Labs
    - Lab 01 is due Thursday 2025-01-30 at 9 AM to Canvas.
    - There is a "Lab 0" worked example to look at first.
    - Deadlines and instructions for all labs are on the website.

There are no quizzes or examinations in 500.

## A Key Goal for the Project and Course

* Help you learn how to tackle a problem, rather than just be able to perform particular statistical techniques.
    + Goal: think and solve problems when trying to infer causal effects from observational data
* But the need to think in statistical terms is omnipresent
    + Identifying researchable problems
    + Dealing with variation
    + Interplay of Design and Analysis
    + Preparing, writing and revising results, in a replicable way.

# A Motivating Example (Aspirin and Mortality)

## Aspirin and Mortality in Heart Patients

Suppose you want to understand the effect of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid: ASA) on mortality among patients undergoing stress echocardiography.

- What is the population?
- What is the outcome?
- What are the treatments?

## ASA and Mortality in Heart Patients

Suppose you want to understand aspirin's effect on all-cause five-year mortality among patients undergoing stress echocardiography.

- Comparing ASA to "No ASA"
- What are the potential outcomes here?

## ASA and Mortality in Heart Subjects

- Suppose you want to study the effect of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid: ASA) on all-cause mortality.
- You identify an interesting group of Subjects as those undergoing stress echocardiography.
    - Your goal is to compare ASA Subjects to "no ASA" Subjects

What would be the **ideal** study?

Step 1. Identify a large group of Subjects from the population at Time 0.

- We want to understand the causal effect of aspirin on all-cause five-year mortality among patients undergoing stress echocardiography.
- Having identified a set of patients, what is the ideal study?

Step 2?

## ASA and Mortality in Heart Patients

- Designing the Study

We want to understand aspirin's effect on all-cause five-year mortality among patients undergoing stress echocardiography.

- OK.
- What's the best **practical** study?

## ASA and Mortality in Heart Patients

- Designing the Study

We want to understand aspirin's effect on all-cause five-year mortality among patients undergoing stress echocardiography.

- But what if we **cannot** do an RCT?

## How Do We Avoid Being Misled?

- What differentiates an observational study from a randomized controlled trial?
    - One key element: potential for selection bias.
- What is selection bias and what can we do about it?
    - Baseline characteristics of comparison groups are different in ways that affect the outcome.

We will often distinguish between overt and hidden bias. 

- Overt Bias (seen in data - propensity scores can help)
- Hidden Bias (required data not collected - requires sensitivity analyses)

## Aspirin Use and Mortality - The Real Study

6174 consecutive adults at CCF undergoing stress echocardiography for evaluation of known or suspected coronary disease\footnote{Gum PA et al. Aspirin use and all-cause mortality among patients being evaluated for known or suspected coronary artery disease: A propensity analysis JAMA 2001 Sep 12; 286(10): 1187-94. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11559263/}.

- 2310 (37\%) were taking aspirin (treatment).
- Main Outcome: all-cause mortality 
    + Median follow-up: 3.1 years
- Univariate Analysis: 4.5\% of aspirin patients died, and 4.5\% of non-aspirin patients died.
    + Unadjusted Hazard Ratio: 1.08 (0.85, 1.39)

More on this study to come.

# Next Time...

## Recorded Lecture 2

- How Can We Avoid Being Misled by Observational Studies?
    + What is **selection bias** and why should I care about it?
    + What can be done to deal with selection bias in observational studies?
- What is a propensity score, and how do we ... 
    + estimate it, 
    + see how well it's working, and
    + use it to estimate causal effects?

The slides I use will be posted to the Class 02 README.
