## Abstract of Ahmed et al.

## From the Introduction

> The majority of heart failure (HF) patients are ≥65 years, and most
deaths and HF-related hospitalizations in HF patients occur in this
patient group. We have previously demonstrated that in a
propensity-matched cohort of ambulatory patients with mild to
moderate chronic HF, older age ($\geq 65$ years) was associated with
increased mortality but not hospitalization.

The objective of the current study was to examine the independent effect of older age on outcomes in chronic advanced systolic HF patients using a propensity-matched design.

## Data Source and Subjects

> This study was conducted using retrospective analysis of public-use copies of the Beta-Blocker Evaluation of Survival Trial (BEST) datasets obtained from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).

> BEST was a multicenter randomized controlled trial of the beta-blocker bucindolol in chronic systolic HF.

Patients with advanced systolic HF were enrolled from 90 different sites
across the United States and Canada. All patients had New York Heart Association class III or IV symptoms and a left ventricular ejection fraction below 35%.

## Exposure and Outcomes

Exposure: We categorized (2707) patients into two age groups: younger ($< 65$ years) and older ($\geq 65$ years; n = 1091 or 40%).

Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and HF hospitalization. Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular mortality, HF mortality and all-cause hospitalization. All outcomes were centrally adjudicated.

## Greedy Matching Approach

> Using a greedy matching protocol described elsewhere in detail, we were able to match 603 of the 1091 older patients with 603 patients $< 65$ years old who had similar propensity scores.

We began by using a non-parsimonious multivariable logistic regression model to estimate propensity score for age $\geq 65$ years for each of the 2707 participants. In the model, an age $\geq 65$ years was used as the dependent variable and all clinically relevant baseline characteristics
(see Fig. 1, in two slides) were included as covariates.

- The matching process used an SPSS macro published in the second edition of Levesque R, ed. *A Guide for SPSS and SAS Users* 2005. 

## Propensity Matching Results

Before matching, older patients were more likely to have coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease than younger patients. 

After matching, absolute standardized differences between age groups
were $< 10$% for all measured covariates (with the exception of white
blood cell count which was 10.2%) with most values $< 5$% demonstrating
substantial covariate balance across the groups (Love plot, next slide.)

## Love Plot (Figure 1)

## All-Cause Mortality Effect?

All-cause mortality occurred in 33% (202/603) and 36% (215/603)
of matched younger and older patients respectively during 4 years of
follow-up. 

The hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality when older patients are compared to younger patients was HR = 1.05, 95% CI: 0.87 - 1.27.

## Conclusions

In conclusion, in patients with advanced chronic systolic HF, older
age is an important marker of increased mortality and hospitalization,
but has no intrinsic effect on outcome. Therapeutic decisions in older
adults with advanced HF should not be biased on the basis of age alone.
